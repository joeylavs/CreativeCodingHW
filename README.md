The Last Sprint is a pixelated survival chase game set in a vast, snow-covered wilderness. 
Players take on the role of a lone Native American warrior, desperately fleeing from the relentless Wendigo. 
Inspired by SkiFree, the game emphasizes speed, strategy, and survival, requiring players to manage their stamina while navigating treacherous terrain.

The movement system is running-based, with players needing to balance sprinting and resting to stay ahead. 
Along the way, various power-ups can be collected to aid survival. 
Arrows slow down the Wendigo, talismans provide temporary protection, and food restores stamina, with different items offering varying levels of recovery.

At its core, The Last Sprint is a fast-paced survival experience where players must rely on quick thinking, strategic movement,
and limited resources to escape the clutches of the Wendigo.
