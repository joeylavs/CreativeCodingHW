I believe that learning styles do affect how we learn. For example in high school they have the advance classes for faster learners normal classes for normal pace learners and they now have alternative schools that help students learn at a pace that best for them. learning styles should help a person learn but it is figuring out which one to use for a class that will be hard because of how different everyone is. Every person isnt the same and therefore have different learning styles and pacing that help them learn.
