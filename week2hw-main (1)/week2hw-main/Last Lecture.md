When i watched the last lecture the thing that affected me most was how calm and happy he was even with his cancer. Im Native american and the ones ive been around use comedy as a remedy for situations like this it definety feel better to laugh then cry so this really stood out to me and made it more relatable. Id say i do identify with the message of him having so many dreams and him pursuing each one and him achieving, failing and learning from each one. A couple of my dreams ive tried or are still trying one was being a nba player but I didnt have the athletism for it and quit another dream was being a astronomer but i was only interested in scratching the surface once you get deeper it got to complex for me to understand i still love learning about space just cant get too complex on it. My current dream is to make or help make video games which is why i came back to the University of Montana. Im a gamer and have always had a interest in video games and when i read about the video game design degree here i was intrested i hope to pursue this dream and achieve it but from this video i know that failing is ok and learning whether you fit in that role is a good learning experience.
