The differences between CLI and GUI are that CLI uses text commands to execute programs and are more complex. 
CLI is also more efficent and faster also has higher precision functionality and granular control.
CLI also need to have more accurate commands to function as well making it more complex to use. 
While GUI is more visual like using a mouse and keyboard and is also simplified and user friendly by using thing like icons, buttons, and menus.
GUI use the systems resources to work making easier for people to learn to use and can be modified to fit the users needs.
